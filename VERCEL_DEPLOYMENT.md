# Vercel Deployment Instructions for CREATOR-EBOOK-AI

## Project Configuration

This project is now properly configured for Vercel deployment as a Node.js application with static frontend.

### Build Process

The build process creates two output directories:
- `dist/` - Contains the compiled TypeScript server code
- `build/` - Contains the static frontend files (for Vercel compatibility)

### Key Configuration Files

1. **vercel.json** - Configures Vercel deployment with proper routing
2. **package.json** - Updated build scripts for dual output
3. **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration for server compilation

### Deployment Steps

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set the build command to: `npm run build`
3. Set the output directory to: `build` (for static files)
4. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
   - `GROK_API_KEY`
   - `VEO3_API_KEY`
   - `NODE_ENV=production`

### API Routes

The application provides the following endpoints:
- `/api/create-ebook` - eBook generation
- `/api/tts` - Text-to-speech
- `/api/generate-text` - Text generation
- `/api/generate-video` - Video generation
- `/health` - Health check

### Static Files

Static files are served from the `/build` directory and include:
- `index.html` - Main frontend interface
- All assets from the `public/` folder

This configuration ensures both the Node.js backend and static frontend are properly deployed on Vercel.
